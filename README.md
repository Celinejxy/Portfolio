# Data Science Portfolio - Arch Desai
This Portfolio is a compilation of all the Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done for academic, self-learning and hobby purposes. This portfolio is updated on the regular basis.

## Projects
- ### Manufacturing
    - [Survival Analysis of Aircraft Engines](https://github.com/archd3sai/Survival-Analysis-of-Aircraft-Engines) : A Weibull Time-to-event Recurrent Neural Network (WTTE-RNNs) model to find out the remaining useful life of an Aircraft engine based on the past sensor data. The model uses a sequential neural network that can look at historical data and output the two parameters (alpha and beta) that control the shape of the Weibull distribution used to describe time-to-event data.
  
    - [Machine Predictive Maintenance](https://github.com/archd3sai/Machine-Predictive-Maintenance-PdM-) : In this project I aim to apply predictive maintenance techniques over 100MB of historical data from twenty of the units of a company that failed in the field. My objective is to see if there is a similarity in information of the units who had longest lives or shortest lives and to predict which active units will fail soon.

- ### Consumer Goods and Services
  - [Hybrid News Articles Recommendation Engine](https://github.com/archd3sai/News-Articles-Recommendation) : A hybrid-filtering personalized news articles recommendation system which can suggest articles from popular news service providers based on reading history of twitter users who share similar interests (Collaborative filtering) and content similarity of the article and userâ€™s tweets (Content-based filtering).
  
  - [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/archd3sai/Customer-Churn-Prediction) : Objective of this project is to perform independent analysis to find out what leads to the attrition of a customer in a Telecommunications industries. I also implementd classification model to accurately classify whether the customer will churn or not based on his or her information. 
  
  - [Hourly Energy Consumption Prediction](https://github.com/archd3sai/Hourly-Energy-Consumption-Prediction) : In this project I used novel models such as XgBoost and Fbprophet on the hourly energy consumption data to accurately predict energy usage in the future. Features are extracted from timestamps to find trends on daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly basis and Fbprophet model's performance is improved by incorporating public holidays in the analysis.

- ### Economics and Finance
  - [What's the GDP of India?](https://github.com/archd3sai/Predicting-GDP-of-India) : Objective of this project is to perform predictive assesment on the Gross Domestic Product of India through an inferential analysis of various socio-economic factors to find out which predictors contribute most to the GDP.
  
  - [Loan Default Prediction](https://github.com/archd3sai/Loan-Default-Prediction) : In this project I applied various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest and LightGBM to to accurately detect and classify consumers who will default the loan. LightGBM resulted into highest accuracy which is 98.89%.
  
- ### Sports
    - [Ranking of NFL teams using Markov-chain methods](https://github.com/archd3sai/Ranking-of-NFL-Teams-using-Markov-method/blob/master/Ranking%20of%20NFL%20teams%20Report.pdf) : In this project I implemented and compared three stationary distribution of Markov-chain based approaches to rank 32 NFL (National Football League) teams from "Best" to "Worst" using the scores of 2007 NFL regular season
    
    - [Ranking of Tennis players](https://github.com/archd3sai/Tennis-Players-Ranking) : Objective of this project is to rank all Tennis Players based on the matches they played in the year of 2018. This project comprises 4 approaches to rank Tennis players and I have tried to make these approaches more robust sequentially.
