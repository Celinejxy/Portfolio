**[Hybrid-filtering News Articles Recommendation Engine](https://github.com/archd3sai/News-Articles-Recommendation)**
 
A hybrid-filtering personalized news articles recommendation system which can suggest articles from popular news service providers based on reading history of twitter users who share similar interests (Collaborative filtering) and content similarity of the article and user’s tweets (Content-based filtering).

</br>

   - [Wind Turbine Power Curve Estimation](https://github.com/archd3sai/Wind-Turbine-Power-Curve-Estimation) : In this project, I have employed various regression techniques to estimate the Power curve of a Wind turbine located on a land. Nonlinear trees based regression methods perform best as true power curve is nonlinear. I have optimized XGBoost using GridSearchCV that yields lowest Test RMSE-6.404. The project also contains good data visualizations.
   
   - [Instacart Market Basket Analysis](https://github.com/archd3sai/Instacart-Market-Basket-Analysis) : The objective of this project is to predict which previously purchased products will be in a user’s next order using the anonymized data of 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users open sourced by Instacart. 
   
   - [Customer Survival Analysis and Churn Prediction](https://github.com/archd3sai/Customer-Survival-Analysis-and-Churn-Prediction) : In this project I have utilized non-parametric survival analysis methods such as Kaplan-Meier and log-rank test to find out how the likelihood of the customer churn changes over time. I also implementd logistic regression model to accurately predict whether the customer will churn or not and what leads to the attrition. 
   
   - [Multivariate Phase 1 Analysis](https://github.com/archd3sai/Multivariate-Phase-1-Analysis) : Objective of this project is to identify the in-control data points and eliminate out of control data points to set up distribution parameters for the future monitoring of manufacturing process. 
   
   - [What's the GDP of India?](https://github.com/archd3sai/Predicting-GDP-of-India) : Objective of this project is to perform predictive assesment on the Gross Domestic Product of India through an inferential analysis of various socio-economic factors to find out which predictors contribute most to the GDP.
    
   - [Aircraft Engines RUL Prediction](https://github.com/archd3sai/Aircraft-Engine-RUL-Prediction) : Objective of this project is to built a sequential neural network which can predict the remaining useful life of an engine based on historical sensor data. For this regression problem, I employed keras Long-short-term-memory (LSTM) model with 'relu' activation function and 'rmsprop' optimizer to predict time-to-event.

   - [Loan Default Prediction](https://github.com/archd3sai/Loan-Default-Prediction) : In this project I applied various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest and LightGBM to to accurately detect and classify consumers who will default the loan. LightGBM resulted into highest accuracy which is 98.89%.

## Micro Projects
- ### Ranking Algorithms
    - [Ranking of NFL teams using Markov-chain methods](https://github.com/archd3sai/Ranking-of-NFL-Teams-using-Markov-method/blob/master/Ranking%20of%20NFL%20teams%20Report.pdf) : In this project I implemented and compared three stationary distribution of Markov-chain based approaches to rank 32 NFL (National Football League) teams from "Best" to "Worst" using the scores of 2007 NFL regular season.
    - [Ranking of Tennis players](https://github.com/archd3sai/Tennis-Players-Ranking/blob/master/TennisRanking.ipynb) : Objective of this project is to rank all Tennis Players based on the matches they played in the year of 2018. This project comprises 4 approaches to rank Tennis players and I have tried to make these approaches more robust sequentially.
    
- ### Statistics and Machine Learning
    - [Bayesian Statistics](https://github.com/archd3sai/Statistical-Methods/blob/master/Bayesian%20Statistics.ipynb) : In this project, I explored how bayesian statistics works and how prior assumption reflects posterior probabilities using Gun control example. 
    - [Gaussian Mixture Model and Expectation Maximization](https://github.com/archd3sai/Statistical-Methods/blob/master/GMM-EM.ipynb): In this project, I implemented Expectation Maximization algorithm to find out true distribution of one dimensional GMM of 2 gaussians.
    - [Linear Regression](https://github.com/archd3sai/Statistical-Methods/blob/master/Linear%20Regression.ipynb): In this project, I aim to solve linear regression using analytical method and also by implementing gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent and minibatch gradient descent algorithms. 
    - [Neural Network Implementation](https://github.com/archd3sai/Statistical-Methods/blob/master/NN%20Implementation.ipynb) In this project, I implemented simple neural network using forward propogation, backword propogation and optimization functions to predict the customer churn.
